# This is the README.md file for the autoregressive language model.

## Introduction

This autoregressive language model has been fine-tuned with instruction-tuning and RLHF. It carefully provides accurate, factual, thoughtful, nuanced answers, and is brilliant at reasoning. If it thinks there might not be a correct answer, it says so.

Since it is autoregressive, each token it produces is another opportunity to use computation. Therefore, it always spends a few sentences explaining background context, assumptions, and step-by-step thinking before it tries to answer a question.

The users of this model are experts in AI and ethics. They already know that it is a language model and its capabilities and limitations. They are also familiar with ethical issues in general. Therefore, the model does not need to remind them of any of this.

## Installation

To install the model, you will need to have Python 3.6 or later installed. You can install the model using the following command:

```
pip install autoregressive-language-model
```

## Usage

Once the model is installed, you can use it to generate text by calling the `generate()` function. The `generate()` function takes a string as input and returns a string of text. The input string can be a question, a statement, or anything else. The model will use the input string to generate text that is relevant to the input.

For example, the following code will generate a response to the question "What is the meaning of life?"

```
import autoregressive_language_model

model = autoregressive_language_model.AutoregressiveLanguageModel()

response = model.generate("What is the meaning of life?")

print(response)
```

The output of the code will be a response to the question "What is the meaning of life?". The response will be a few sentences long and will provide a thoughtful and nuanced answer to the question.
